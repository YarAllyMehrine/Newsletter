## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript
- JQuery

### What I learned

It is my first project using JQuery since i have learnt it and it really helps with the DOM Manipulation. 

### Continued development

I will use Tailwind CSS for the next project. But I also need to check out the side-effect of the css styling.
